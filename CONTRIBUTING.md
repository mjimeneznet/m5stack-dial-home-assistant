# Contributing

Thanks for improving Home Assistant Controller for M5Stack Dial.

## Before opening a pull request

- Keep credentials out of the repository.
- Run `esphome config dial.yaml` before submitting changes.
- Keep page files focused: one feature page per YAML file in `pages/`.
- Avoid committing generated build output, virtual environments, caches, or local IDE settings.
- Document any new Home Assistant entity dependency in `docs/configuration.md`.

## Code style

- Use lowercase snake_case filenames.
- Use clear LVGL ID prefixes: `page_`, `lbl_`, `btn_`, `arc_`, `img_`.
- Prefer substitutions for user-specific entity IDs.
- Keep image assets small enough for ESP32-S3 without PSRAM.
