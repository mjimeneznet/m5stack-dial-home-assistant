Home Assistant Controller for M5Stack Dial is an independent community project maintained and personalised by [mjimeneznet](https://github.com/mjimeneznet). It is not an official project of M5Stack, ESPHome, or Home Assistant.

## What is this?

This firmware turns an M5Stack Dial into a physical Home Assistant controller. The rotary wheel, touch screen and front button make everyday actions—such as checking the room, changing a light, adjusting the climate or controlling music—available without repeatedly opening a phone dashboard.

The interface is built with ESPHome and LVGL, and is organised into pages and reusable components so individual features can be configured or adapted without having to rewrite the entire firmware. This repository is actively maintained as a tailored M5Stack Dial experience, with its own Home Assistant integrations and UI behaviour.

## Origins and credits

This project is based on the original [**Smart Home Button** project](https://github.com/Jasionf/smart-home-button) created by [Jason Wen](https://github.com/Jasionf).

The original project provided the M5Stack Dial hardware configuration, ESPHome and LVGL foundation, and the initial Clock, Light, Climate, Music and Timer interfaces.

This derivative adds configurable Home Assistant light entities through `dial_lights`, optional menu pages, live menu status, AQI support, improved navigation, configurable screen-idle management and other Home Assistant-focused improvements.

Many thanks to Jason Wen for creating and sharing the foundation of this project.

## Features

- Clock, date and weather from Home Assistant.
- Air-quality index (AQI) from a Home Assistant sensor.
- Circular menu navigation with the encoder, touch gestures and front button.
- Configurable Home Assistant lights through `dial_lights`.
- Climate control through a `climate_entity`.
- Media playback, volume and metadata through a `music_player_entity`.
- Home Assistant timer control through a `timer_entity`.
- Menu subtitles based on live Home Assistant states.
- Automatic return to the clock after inactivity.
- Configurable backlight dimming and screen-off behaviour.
- Wake from dimmed or screen-off state without leaving the current page.
- Visual and audible notification when a timer finishes.

## Pages

| Page | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Clock | Shows the time, date, weather and AQI information from Home Assistant. |
| Menu | Circular navigation with live subtitles for configured Home Assistant features. |
| Lights | Controls the Home Assistant light entities declared in `dial_lights`. |
| AC | Shows the state of `climate_entity` and changes its target temperature and power. |
| Music | Controls `music_player_entity`, including playback, volume and available metadata. |
| Timer | Uses `timer_entity` as the source of truth for a Home Assistant countdown timer. |

## Hardware

The firmware targets the M5Stack Dial platform and its ESP32-S3 controller. The configuration uses the Dial's 240 × 240 GC9A01A round display, FT5x06 capacitive touch controller, rotary encoder, front button, PCF8563 RTC, buzzer and display backlight.

M5Stack Dial V1.1 is the tested target. GPIO46 power hold is configured for V1.1 so the device remains powered when running on battery. Other revisions may work, but are not currently verified by this maintained project.

## Requirements

- A compatible M5Stack Dial.
- Home Assistant.
- ESPHome.
- Wi-Fi access for the Dial.
- Home Assistant entities only for the features and information you want to enable.

Weather and AQI are optional: unavailable or omitted entities leave incomplete data or `--` on the Clock page. Timer, AC, Music and Lights are also optional; those menu entries disappear when left at their package placeholders or, for Lights, when `dial_lights` is empty.

## Quick installation

1. In ESPHome, create a new device configuration and add your credentials as secrets.
2. Use the following configuration, replacing the entity IDs with your own Home Assistant entities.
3. Install it on the Dial over USB for the first flash, then use OTA updates as usual.

```yaml
substitutions:
  timezone: Europe/Madrid

  api_encryption_key: !secret api_encryption_key
  wifi_ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  wifi_password: !secret wifi_password

  weather_entity: weather.estacion_meteorologica
  aqi_entity: sensor.aqi_jardin_pm2_5
  climate_entity: climate.ac_buhardilla
  music_player_entity: media_player.arylic_lp100
  timer_entity: timer.temporizador_dial

  screen_return_timeout: 30s
  screen_dim_timeout: 15s
  screen_off_timeout: 60s
  screen_dim_brightness: "20%"

dial_lights:
  - entity_id: light.sofa
    name: Sofá

  - entity_id: light.mesa
    name: Mesa

  - entity_id: light.luces_jardin
    name: Jardín

packages:
  smart_home_button:
    url: https://github.com/mjimeneznet/m5stack-dial-home-assistant
    ref: main
    files:
      - dial.yaml
    refresh: 0s
```

Create the referenced secrets in ESPHome, for example:

```yaml
api_encryption_key: "replace-with-an-ESPHome-api-key"
wifi_ssid: "your-wifi-network"
wifi_password: "your-wifi-password"
```

The package already contains the device hardware, pages and components. A normal installation only needs this local configuration; do not edit `main/entities.yaml`, `pages/main.yaml` or other package files. To disable Lights explicitly, use an empty list:

```yaml
dial_lights: []
```

`ref: main` follows the version currently published on `main`. `refresh: 0s` makes ESPHome check the remote package on every configuration or build, which is useful while tracking that branch but depends on GitHub being reachable and can add download time. It is optional; pin a tag or commit in `ref` when reproducible builds matter.

For all fields, defaults and advanced cases, see [the configuration reference](docs/configuration.md).

## Navigation

The Dial supports the rotary encoder, the front button and horizontal touch gestures. In general, a short press opens or accepts, a rapid double press performs Back, and a long press has no action. Touch widgets retain their page-specific actions.

| Context | Rotate | Short press | Double press / Touch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clock (Home) | No action | Opens Menu | Long press: no action. Swipe left or right opens Menu. |
| Menu | Moves the circular selection | Opens the selected page; Home returns to Clock | Tap a visible menu item to open it. Swipe left confirms; swipe right returns to Clock. |
| Lights | Changes brightness or the active selector value | Opens/accepts the selected light, according to context | Double press or swipe right goes back. Touch controls power, colour picker and colour confirmation. |
| AC | Changes the selected value | Accepts or confirms the current edit | Double press or swipe right goes back. Touch selects controls and toggles power, fan mode or HVAC mode. |
| Music | Changes volume | Accepts the current action where applicable | Double press or swipe right goes back. Touch controls playback and transport. |
| Timer | Adjusts the selected duration unit while the timer is idle | Starts, pauses, resumes or clears the finished state | Double press or swipe right goes back. Touch selects hours/minutes/seconds and accesses reset/cancel. |

The first encoder turn, button press or touch gesture after the screen has dimmed or turned off only wakes the display; repeat the action to control the interface.

## Screen management

The package offers four substitutions for idle behaviour:

```yaml
substitutions:
  screen_dim_timeout: 45s
  screen_return_timeout: 5min
  screen_off_timeout: 30min
  screen_dim_brightness: "20%"
```

`DIM` lowers the backlight and preserves the current page. `RETURN` intentionally navigates to Clock. `OFF` turns off only the backlight and preserves the current page. They are independent stages. Set any timeout to `0s` to disable that stage. When `OFF` is enabled, its effective timeout is raised if necessary so it is not earlier than either enabled DIM or RETURN timeout.

An active Home Assistant timer blocks only automatic return to the clock; a paused timer does not. DIM and OFF continue to work for either state. When the timer finishes, the Dial wakes, opens Timer and runs its blink-and-beep feedback.

## Live menu status

The Menu is more than a launcher: its current selection shows a live subtitle. Timer shows remaining time or its state; Lights shows a single light's brightness or how many configured lights are on; AC shows HVAC mode and target temperature; Music shows title or playback state; and Home shows `Clock`.

## Feature notes

### Music

The Music page is controlled through `music_player_entity`. Home Assistant provides playback state, play/pause and transport actions, volume, title and metadata, plus duration and position when available. SendSpin is optional and is currently used only to provide 100 × 100 album artwork when a compatible SendSpin source is available. Album art is intentionally kept small for the Dial's memory budget.

### Climate

Available climate controls depend on `climate_entity`. The page reads and changes target temperature, and uses the entity's advertised HVAC and fan modes when available. Do not expect a control that the selected Home Assistant climate integration does not expose.

### Timer

`timer_entity` is the source of truth. The same timer can be controlled from Home Assistant dashboards and automations as well as the Dial. A YAML-defined Home Assistant timer may use `restore: true`, but it is optional.

### Battery

The package enables GPIO46 at boot for M5Dial V1.1 battery power hold. This keeps that revision powered after wake when running on battery.

## Troubleshooting

- **Device does not appear in Home Assistant:** confirm Wi-Fi, API connectivity and a valid `api_encryption_key`.
- **A menu item is hidden:** configure its matching entity, or add at least one entry to `dial_lights`; `dial_lights: []` intentionally hides Lights.
- **AQI shows `--`:** use an existing numeric sensor for `aqi_entity`.
- **A feature is unavailable:** check that its configured entity exists and is available in Home Assistant.
- **Music is unavailable:** use the entity that actually plays audio and exposes its media state.
- **Timer is unavailable:** create or enable the referenced Home Assistant Timer helper.
- **Package changes are missing:** use `refresh: 0s` while testing, then reload or recompile the ESPHome configuration.
- **Fonts, glyphs or compilation fail:** ensure the first build can download its dependencies and use the ESPHome version in `requirements.txt`.
- **First installation fails over the network:** flash over USB first, then use ESPHome OTA updates.

## Development and customisation

This section is for people cloning the repository, not for normal package users. Create a local `secrets.yaml` from `secrets.example.yaml`, install the pinned dependencies, then validate and compile locally:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Activate .venv (Scripts\Activate.ps1 on Windows, bin/activate on macOS/Linux)
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
esphome config dial.yaml
esphome compile dial.yaml
```

Page customisation lives under `pages/`; hardware and idle behaviour are under `main/`. Keep local secrets out of Git.
